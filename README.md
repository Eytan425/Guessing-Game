# Guessing-Game

How the game works:
First, you sign in. If you are a new user, you get 100 coins
If you are an old user, you continue with the amount of coins you had.
A number is generated. When you guess it, if you can't guess it, you can buy a hint. A hint costs 10 coins
Once you guess it, you get 100 coins that are added to your account.
